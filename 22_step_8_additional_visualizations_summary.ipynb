    "- Minimal Age Effect: The most striking finding is that age has virtually no meaningful relationship with campaign acceptance. The correlation of -0.019 is essentially zero, indicating no practical relationship between age and response rates (very weak, non-significant relationship).\n",
    "- Consistent Acceptance Across Age Groups: The acceptance rates across all age groups cluster between 13-16%, with the 60-70 age group showing the lowest rate at approximately 13% and the <40 and 70+ groups showing the highest at around 16%. This 3 percentage point difference is quite small from a practical standpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Statistical Considerations\n",
    "- Sample Size Reliability: The scatterplot reveals that the 60-70 age group has the smallest sample size (467), while the 50-60 group has the largest (674). The smaller sample size for the 60-70 group may contribute to the slightly lower observed acceptance rate, but the confidence intervals shown in the bar chart suggest these differences aren't statistically significant.\n",
    "- Age Distribution Insights: The first chart shows that both accepted and non-accepted groups have very similar age distributions, with mean ages differing by only 0.62 years (56.2 vs 55.6). This minimal difference reinforces that age is not a meaningful predictor.\n",
